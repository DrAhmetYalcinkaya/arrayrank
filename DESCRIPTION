Description: This package uses limma to extract autoantibody data from genepix (.gpr) protein arrays, either from single-sample arrays like Huprot or custom arrays and chambered/segmented arrays (used to analyze multiple patient samples in different blocks). Facilitates background correction, low-value replacement (offset), extraction to a dataframe, normalization (limma betweenarrays, limma quantile, or variable-based), and storable dataset creation. Based on output manipulation, it is then possible to detect variables (proteins) for which increased immunoreactivity is detected based on a number of factors, including fold-change, absolute response, shared hits, and combinations of these features. Allows selection of a control group and target groups to be examined for hits.
