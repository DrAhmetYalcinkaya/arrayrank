Description: This package uses limma to extract autoantibody data from protein arrays, either from complete arrays like Huprot or custom arrays and chambered/segmented arrays (where a single array is used to analyze multiple patient samples in different blocks). Facilitates background correction, low-value replacement (offset), extraction to a dataframe, normalization (limma betweenarrays, limma quantile, or variable-based), and storable dataset creation. Based on output manipulation, it is then possible to detect variables (proteins) for which increased immunoreactivity is detected based on a number of factors, including fold-change, absolute response, shared hits, and combinations of these features. Allows selection of a control group and groups to be examined for hits.
