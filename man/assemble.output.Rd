\title{Assemble Protein Data with Key Matching and Excel Export}
\usage{
assemble.output(
  key,
  wide_df,
  corr_df,
  norm_df,
  file_name = "Data_complete.xlsx"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{key}{A data frame with at least an "Array" column and associated metadata. Preferably, the key file will contain "Array", "Group", and "Sample" columns in that order).}

\item{wide_df}{Raw protein expression data (proteins as rows, samples as columns, based on the read output).}

\item{corr_df}{Offset-corrected data (same structure as wide_df).}

\item{norm_df}{Normalized data (same structure as wide_df).}

\item{file_name}{Name of the output Excel file (defaults to "Data_complete.xlsx").}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames (Raw, Offset, Norm) that are also written to Excel in your working directory.
}
\description{
Matches sample keys to multiple datasets (raw, offset-corrected, normalized),
adds protein names, and writes each dataset as a separate sheet in a single Excel file.
