\title{Assemble and Format Protein Data for Multiple Analysis Types}
\usage{
assemble.output(
  key,
  wide_df,
  corr_df,
  norm_df,
  file_name = "Data_complete.xlsx"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{key}{A data frame with at least an "Array" column and associated metadata,
such as "Group" and "Sample".}

\item{wide_df}{Raw protein expression data (proteins as rows, samples as columns).}

\item{corr_df}{Offset-corrected data (same structure as wide_df).}

\item{norm_df}{Normalized data (same structure as wide_df).}

\item{file_name}{Name of the output Excel file.}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames. It includes 'Raw', 'Offset', 'Norm' (for Excel),
as well as wide-format 'analysis_set' and tidy-format 'tidied_analysis_set'
for each of the three data types.
}
\description{
This function prepares protein data in multiple formats. It creates wide-format
data for Excel, and generates both wide and tidy analysis sets for each of the
three input data types (raw, offset-corrected, normalized).
