\usage{
detect.hits(
  data,
  group_vector = NULL,
  controls,
  examine = NULL,
  sdmean = 0.7,
  min_mean = 250,
  fold_threshold = 10,
  absolute_threshold = 7000,
  fold_shared = 1,
  abs_shared = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the protein expression data, where rows represent proteins and columns represent different samples. The first column should contain protein names.}

\item{group_vector}{An optional character vector specifying the group labels for the samples. If not provided, the function will assume the first row of the data frame contains group labels.}

\item{controls}{A character string specifying the label of the control group.}

\item{examine}{An optional character vector specifying the non-control group labels to be analyzed. If NULL, all groups except the control group are analyzed.}

\item{sdmean}{A numeric value specifying the threshold for the standard deviation to mean ratio used for filtering. Default is 0.7.}

\item{min_mean}{A numeric value specifying the minimum mean expression level required for a protein to be considered. Default is 250.}

\item{fold_threshold}{A numeric value specifying the fold change threshold for detecting significant hits. Default is 10.}

\item{absolute_threshold}{A numeric value specifying the absolute expression threshold for detecting significant hits. Default is 7000.}

\item{fold_shared}{An integer specifying the minimum number of non-control samples that must exceed the fold change threshold. Default is 1.}

\item{abs_shared}{An integer specifying the minimum number of non-control samples that must exceed the absolute threshold. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A data frame of ranked significant protein hits, including the highest fold change, the number of potential hits, control mean expression, and a ranking score.
}
\description{
This function identifies and ranks significant protein hits by comparing the expression levels between control and non-control groups in microarray data. It applies several filters based on the standard deviation to mean ratio, minimum mean expression, fold change, and absolute thresholds.
